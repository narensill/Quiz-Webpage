# General Knowledge Quiz Webpage 
This project is a dynamic General Knowledge Quiz built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz features multiple-choice questions on various topics, offering a smooth and interactive user experience.

## HTML
The HTML structure defines the layout of the quiz, including the quiz container, question display, and result area. It serves as the foundation for the content and ensures a user-friendly interface.

## CSS
CSS is used to style the quiz, creating a visually appealing and responsive design. The background image, transparent quiz container, and button styles are all handled through CSS, providing a cohesive look and feel across devices.

## JavaScript
JavaScript powers the functionality of the quiz. It dynamically loads questions, handles user interactions, checks answers, and tracks the score. The script also updates the UI in real-time, providing immediate feedback to users and displaying the final score upon completion
